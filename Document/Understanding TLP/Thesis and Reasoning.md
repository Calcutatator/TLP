### Onchain Games Affordances
Fully Onchain Games has several key affordances created that differ from “Normal” games.
- Economic
    - Open uncensorable blockchains allow for trustless exchange of value.
    - Economic structures can be formed within games.
    - Assets can be created and emitted.
- Trust/Integrity
    - Transparency of blockchains creates trust in the assets within games.
    - Immutable contracts allow for trust.
    - Provability of computation allows for integrity to be established within “offchain” games.
- Composability
    - Open API’s allow for use cases to derive between both protocols and assets.
    - Open source protocols allow for compounding of components and experiences.
Fully onchain games must leverage these affordances therefore creating an abundance of  trusted protocols, assets and experiences.

### Bootstrapping Liquidity
The hardest part of creating a token is bootstrapping long term deep liquid markets. A token without liquid markets will struggle to maintain both price and allow for larger participants to enter/exit efficiently without decimating supply.

To create a liquid token the are several options for a new token:

- You require immediate massive demand and equally matched supply (Pray)
    - Low liquidity will create erratic volatility of your token.
    - Volatility will disincentivise liquidity providers causing even more volatility.
    - Less liquidity will not allow larger market participants to enter the market.
- Require external investment to maintain price and liquidity. 
    - Selling either equity + tokens to investors causes long term supply of tokens to the market.
    - Long term will align investors but will require selling the token with large discounts.
- Incentivise liquidity through token incentives.
    - Naked token incentives cause long term downward pressure on token through increasing supply without increased demand.
    - Incentivises mercenary capital to simply farm then leave, not creating any “sticky” liquidity.
- Hire market makers to maintain liquidity.
    - Requires giving away a large % of token supply.
    - Many market makers employ underhand loan and option schemes to extract capital from end users.

The current options for new tokens within both our ecosystem and the wider crypto space to start successful are not showing an easy path to success.

### Let Studios Create
The recent studio alignment proposal shows the depth of teams we are working with to create an interconnected network of protocols and experiences. The protocols within the current framework are all pushed to leverage LORDS within their games.

This causes some issues already arising within teams. 

- Lords isn’t a fee token: Loot Survivor v1 cost 25 LORDS per play. LORDS went up to a price of 64 cent which meant a game cost nearly 16 dollars.
- Teams are limited: Teams such as Underware scoped out ‘Dark Tar’ a token for their world they seek to integrate within our autonomous world. - This token is not acceptable if we are leveraging LORDS throughout the world.
- Teams may simply want their own token: Some teams want to experiment with tokenomics within their games. You can’t dictate tokenomics if decided by another token.
- Teams want their own economy and tokens to oversee their own internal ecosystems and protocols.
- Biblio DAO must allow for this experimentation, if we don’t allow experimentation within the wider ecosystem we may just kill the ideas that would make us successful long term.

### These learnings result in two key reasons behind the design of TLP.

1. Any token or game can plug into the system. Studios can create.
2. Token incentives are used to power liquidity. Teams will earn liquidity for their tokens.
