# ELI5 The Lordship Protocol
The TLP is the foundational economic protocol to tie together all aspects within Realms World.

### WTF is a Realms World?
Realms World is the short hand for the ecosystem being built out by [BiblioDAO](https://www.bibliothecadao.xyz/)

The ecosystem is made up of:
- An Autonomous World
- Gaming Studios
- Defi Protocols
- Art and Lore
- Onchain Games
- DAO's
- Tokens and NFT's

These entities and protocols could be seen as single islands, working together we hope but not economically aligned.

The Lordship Protocol intends to solve this through economic incentives whilst strongly defining the LORDS tokens use case.

### What is this TLP tho?
Simply; A Starknet based protocol leveraging the LORDS token to incentivise & align Liquidity and Games within Realms World.

### How does it work?
It uses game fees and token incentives provided by RealmsDAO to create:
1. Liquidity for tokens in the ecosystem.
2. Incentives to Games and their studios.
