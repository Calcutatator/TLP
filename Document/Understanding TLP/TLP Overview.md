The Lordship Protocol (TLP) is the core economic foundation of Realms World. The core principles of which is to create a positive feedback loop of Liquidity, Fees and alignment between creators, users and speculators.

### The Lordship Protocol
The Lordship Protocol has been designed to serve as an alignment mechanism for the ecosystem of teams, players and speculators that exist within realms.world.

### veLORDS
veLORDS will leverage token incentives and fees to power liquidity and creativity within realms.world. 

This is done by locking LORDS tokens to recive voting power over token incentives. Token incentives come from:
- Game Fees
- Marketplace Fees
- LORDS Emissions

Token incentives will be used to incentivise Liquidity and the Games of Realms.world. Token incentives are wholly overseen by velORDS holders directing them where they decide. Fees from the incentivised games and liquidity pools will then be fed back into veLORDS holders to claim.

Initially all Token incentives will be accrued directly to veLORDS holders intitially allowing for the LORDS holders to get accustomed to the mechanism and capture initialy fees of the protocol.
