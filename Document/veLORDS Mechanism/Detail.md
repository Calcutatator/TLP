Immediately you will not be able to vote with veLORDS but as phase II is introduced you will be able to use your voting power to direct token incentives to liquidity providers.

### How do I get veLORDS
veLORDS are earnt by users staking their LORDS within the Lordship Protocol. A user can stake from 1 week to 4 years, the longer they stake the more veLORDS they will receive.
